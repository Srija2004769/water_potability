# water_potability 
This is a machine learning model built using XGBoost algorithm that detects whether the water with specific features are suitable for driniking or not with an accuracy of 86% and minimal range of false positive rate.
The model is deployed using flask on local host and looking forward to integrate this models using FastApi other than flask.
